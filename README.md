This website totally built in tailwind CSS, the first benefit of using Tailwind is writing CSS that does not grow linearly. By having utility class names that will be shared between elements, it guarantees a consistent bundle size. Furthermore, Tailwind paired with Purge CSS will remove any unused styles so the codebase will not be bloated with extra classes.
